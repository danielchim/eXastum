	Welcome to The eXastum Project
	
	eXastum 3.0 has now entered Alpha development stage
	
=={KNOWN BUGS}==========================================================

	Window reising currently does not work (Tested in Firefox)

=={LICENCING}===========================================================

	Two licences cover content in The eXastum Project

	1. All source code falls under the terms of this licence:
	   https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
	
	2. Artistic works such as icons and sounds fall under this licence:
	   https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode
	
	Basically what this means is for both code and artistic works you 
	modify and share as long as you also share your changes and do not 
	profit from them. While only the CC licence disallows commercial use 
	in the licence the nature of the GNU GPL basically also makes it 
	impossible as you must make source code available and allow sharing.

	EXCEPTION:
	eXastum uses the Liberation Sans font which was not created by me. 
	It's licence is GNU GPLv2 with some exceptions and can be found in 
	sys/skins/default/fonts
