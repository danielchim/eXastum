=={LICENCING}===========================================================

	STUFF MADE BY ME (Brian Millar):

	1. All source code writen by me falls under the terms of the
	   GNU General Public Licence Version 3.
	   See: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
	
	2. Artistic works by me such as icons and sounds fall under the
	   following licence:
	   https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode
	
	Basically what this means is for both code and artistic works you 
	can modify and share as long as you also share your changes and do 
	not profit from them. While only the CC licence disallows commercial 
	use in the licence the nature of the GNU GPL basically also makes it 
	impossible as you must make source code available and allow sharing.
